Chrome extension, a webpage systematically screenshot tool. Support foldering, images compressing and PDF generating.<br />
Using IndexedDB to store the file infos and fileSystem to store the files.<br />
The popup page was developed in Simple Vue.js, together with vuex and vue-material.<br />

......Still under development.......<br />
There's still some space for the optimization of IndexedDB database management and the webpack configurations.<br />
